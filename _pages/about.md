## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science, Gallogly College of Engineering, at the University of Oklahoma (OU). My research primarily focuses on machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), uncertainty quantification, and energy-based models. I explore high-order functional brain dynamics and energy landscape analysis to improve our understanding of cognitive function prediction and neurological disorders.

My work has applications in medical imaging and neuroscience, particularly in understanding brain function after brain tumor resection and in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). I leverage advanced machine learning techniques, including GNNs and energy-based models, to develop more enhanced and interpretable predictive models.
