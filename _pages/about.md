## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Data Science and Analytics Institute at the University of Oklahoma (OU). My research primarily focuses on developing data analytics methods for neuroimaging datasets, particularly functional MRI (fMRI) and EEG. I am especially interested in statistical physics-based methods, such as the pairwise maximum entropy model, and their applications in computational neuroscience.
